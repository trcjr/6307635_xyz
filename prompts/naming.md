# Naming Prompt — 6307635.xyz

## Goal
Create a clever, colorful, VIN-centric name for the 1964 VW Beetle restomod site hosted at `6307635.xyz`.

## Context
The site is a visual build log for a Sea Blue 1964 VW Beetle (VIN 6307635). The tone is fun, meme-friendly, and reflective of restomod culture. EFI is no longer the naming focus.

## Prompts Used

**User Prompt:**  
“Workshop a new title for this site.”

**Refinement:**  
"I'm looking for something bright and colorful. Automotive focused, memes and jokes are good."

**Final Decision:**  
- **Site Title:** *Sea Blue & Sketchy 🌊🔌*  
- **Tagline:** *“Period-correct paint. Period-incorrect everything else.”*

## Notes

The name emphasizes the visual originality (Sea Blue) with tongue-in-cheek reference to mechanical improvisation. Future design may explore stamped-style logos or VIN-plate theming.

Visual branding will mimic a vintage VW chassis plate using the car’s actual VIN (`6307635`). A secondary “restomod joke” version may include the site name or tagline like *“Sea Blue & Sketchy”* or *“Re-Made in North Carolina”*. This strengthens the car’s identity as the foundation of the brand.
