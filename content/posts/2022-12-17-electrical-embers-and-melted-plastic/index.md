It was supposed to be another ordinary day in the shop, but things took an unexpected turn. As I was working on the Beetle, I noticed a strange smell in the air—something burning. A quick investigation revealed an electrical fire had started near the car. The culprit? An old ceiling fan that was poorly wired and connected to the same circuit as the car’s nearby workspace.

The fan sparked violently, and as it melted, bits of plastic were sent flying all over the place. I watched in disbelief as pieces of melted plastic hit the car, leaving streaks of sticky residue on the bodywork. Thankfully, the fire didn’t spread further, and the fan was quickly shut off before any more damage could occur.

The car itself seems to have weathered the storm quite well, all things considered. The plastic marks left on the paint are mostly superficial, and no structural damage was done. The engine and interior were untouched by the flames, which was a huge relief. It’s strange, though, how a seemingly small fire could cause such a mess—it's just another reminder of how unpredictable things can get when working with old cars and even older equipment.

After the fire was dealt with, I took some time to carefully inspect the Beetle. Aside from the cosmetic plastic residue, it’s in relatively good shape. The plan now is to clean off the marks, give the affected areas a good scrub, and touch up any spots where the melted plastic made contact with the paint. A little bit of polish, some elbow grease, and I’m sure it’ll be as good as new.

This episode may have been nerve-wracking, but it wasn’t as catastrophic as it could have been. A couple of lessons learned: always check your wiring, and never underestimate how fast a small electrical mishap can turn into a mess. But, the Beetle lives to see another day—and that’s what matters.
