&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was supposed to be another ordinary day in the shop, but things took an unexpected turn. As I was working on the Beetle, I noticed a strange smell in the airâ€”something burning. A quick investigation revealed an electrical fire had started near the car. The culprit? An old ceiling fan that was poorly wired and connected to the same circuit as the carâ€™s nearby workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fan sparked violently, and as it melted, bits of plastic were sent flying all over the place. I watched in disbelief as pieces of melted plastic hit the car, leaving streaks of sticky residue on the bodywork. Thankfully, the fire didnâ€™t spread further, and the fan was quickly shut off before any more damage could occur.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
